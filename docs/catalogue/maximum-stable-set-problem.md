!!! definizione "Definition 1: Maximum stable set problem"

    Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph.

    1. A <strong>stable set</strong> (also called <strong>independent set</strong>) is a subset $Q \subseteq V$ of pairwise non-adjacent vertices: $\{u,v\} \notin E$ for all $u,v \in Q$ with $u \neq v$.

    2. The <strong>Maximum Stable Set Problem</strong> (MSSP) asks to find a stable set of $G$ whose number of vertices is maximum. Its optimal value is the <strong>stability number</strong> $\alpha(G)$.

<strong>Assumptions</strong>

- We consider nontrivial instances: the graph has at least one edge and at least one non-edge. Formally:

    $$
    1 \le m < \binom{n}{2}.
    $$

- The assumption can be made without loss of generality: if the graph has no edge, every single vertex is a maximum clique and $\omega(G)=1$; if the graph is complete, $V$ itself is a clique and $\omega(G)=n$.

- Defined in [Chapter 5 «The maximum clique problem»](../combinatorial-optimization-problems/clique/index.md#box-3-mcpP-def-MSSP).

- Treated in [Chapter 4 «Vertex coloring»](../combinatorial-optimization-problems/coloring.md).
